# Advent Of Code 2018 Solution Machine

This Mac OS command line application provides solutions to the puzzles on the Advent Of Code web site. 
You will need to be running
version 10.1 or newer of Xcode with Swift 4 in order to use this project.

I have chosen to try and tackle these exercises in Swift mostly as a way to try and learn Swift.

When you run these command line tool applications, make sure to show the Debug area (Command-Shift-Y) 
to enter in which day of the challenge you want to solve, and to see the print output from the Swift code.
